Module 9 Assessment Part II

README:

In this portion of the assessment, our group set out to implement a model using an algotithm researched by one of the other groups. In this case, we were tasked with implementing the 'SVM', or 'Support Vector Machine' algorithm.

To complete this task, we first studied the presentation materials and appendix via the github repository provided by the group who initially researched the algortihm:

After researching the algorithm a bit on our own, we then had to choose a dataset that was previously used in another class exercise with which to implement the algortithm. The Pima Indians Diabetes Database seemed particularly well suited for our needs, so we decided to base our model on it. In our repository, the dataset is in the 'diabetes.csv' file, which can also be downloaded here:

Our next task was to write code to actually implement the algorithm, assess its performance, and compare it to another algorithm we've dealt with in the past. Here we've compared the SVM algorithm to Logistic Regression.

We've created a short presentation on our findings using SVM, and the Power Point slides can be found in the 'group-3-M09-final-presentation.pptx' file. A PDF version is also available.
